JQuery Drills

*** GREAT WORK Lisette, Molly, Liz & Marc ***

- Create an empty h1 element in your index.html with an id of "headline". When your page loads, target this element by its id & append "Hello World" to the element with JQuery.

- Create two text inputs in your index.html with ids of "firstNameIn" and "lastNameIn". Also, create a button with the id of "addGroupMemberButton" and a text of "Add Group Member" for when the button is clicked.

- Continuing with the above, create a ul element on the page with an id of "groupOut". When a new member is added (when the button is clicked), empty this element, then loop through the group array, and display each group member each with their own li element.

- Add an input text field with an id of "firstNameSearchIn" and a "Search" button. When clicked, this will search to see if anyone in the group has the given first name. Use an alert to inform the user of the search result.
